# sql-challenge
There are four files in the repo in addition to this Read.me. There are two `.sql` files, one containing the table schemata, and the other one containing the queries. I originally created the queries using a jupyter notebook, therefore the repo also has a `.ipynb` file. One reason for starting with a jupyter notebook was the output is retained, which is useful for verifying the correctness of my code. The fourth file is a picture of the ERD. I used the code generated from QuickDBD to build the table structure, i.e., schema, but modified it by adding data types (e.g. `varchar()`), primary keys for link tables (2 of them), etc. I also had the change the order of the tables in order for the .sql file to run all at once. I decided to create Views in order to limit the output in the jupyter notebook. Some of the `LIMIT` commands were removed in the `.sql` file version.
