# sql-challenge
There are four files in the repo in addition to this Read.me. There are two `.sql` files, one containing the table schemata, and the other one containing the queries. I originally created the queries using a jupyter notebook, therefore the repo also has a `.ipynb` file. One reason for starting with a jupyter notebook was the that the results of the queries are retained visible in the cell output, which is useful for verifying the correctness of the code, and really getting an understanding of the entire dataset related to the Pewlett Hackard employment records. The fourth file is a picture of the ERD. I used the code generated from QuickDBD to build the table structure, i.e., schema, but modified it by adding data types (e.g. `varchar()`), primary keys for link tables (2 of them), etc. I also had the change the order of the tables in order for the .sql file to run all at once. I decided to `CREATE VIEW`s in order to limit the output in the jupyter notebook. Some of the `LIMIT` commands were removed in the `.sql` file version.
